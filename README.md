# FeedBack from Eventogy:

I would like to thank you for taking the time to talk to us and for completing the task. I regret to inform you that we have decided not to progress further with your application.

Unfortunately, your code did not meet our minimum coding standards. Although the code was well executed, it lacked in a proper file management structure. The model would have benefited from better execution as it can result in duplicated and unmanageable code.

I wish you every success with your job search. Thanks again for your interest in our company and I hope that maybe one day our paths will cross again.
